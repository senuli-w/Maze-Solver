<h1>Maze Solver - Java Application</h1>

<p>This repository contains a Java-based application designed to solve mazes using various algorithms. The application reads a maze from a file or generates one dynamically and then finds the optimal path from the start to the finish point.</p>

<h2>Key Features:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Algorithms implemented:</strong> Breadth-First Search (BFS)</li>
    <li><strong>Customized data structures:</strong> Tailored data structures designed to efficiently represent the maze and support algorithm performance.</li>
    <li><strong>Input options:</strong> Supports maze input via both files and random generation.</li>
    <li><strong>Visual representation:</strong> Displays the maze and the solution path.</li>
    <li><strong>Customizable maze sizes:</strong> Users can define the dimensions of the maze.</li>
    <li><strong>Technology stack:</strong> Java.</li>
</ul>

<p>This project is a great example of algorithmic problem-solving and is ideal for pathfinding and artificial intelligence concepts.</p>
